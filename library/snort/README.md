Clone the code from the Git repository.
```
administrator@olive-iron:~/docker$ git clone https://github.com/joelwking/cat9k-soar.git

```
The configuration file must be updated to specify the Phantom IP address / hostname and the auth token. Edit the configuration file and modify the values as required.

The filepath of the Snort alert file is specified in the `snort.confg` file and is specified here. If you change the `snort.conf` file to specify a different filepath, change it here as well.

The variable *msg_tag* is a search string to identify which alerts generated by a match to Snort `local.rules` should be pushed to Phantom. 


```
administrator@olive-iron:~/docker$ cd cat9k-soar/library
administrator@olive-iron:~/docker/cat9k-soar/library$ cat snort/snort.yml

#
#  configuration file for snort.py
#
alert_csv: /var/log/snort/alert.csv
msg_tag: '__cat9K_'

phantom:
    short_name: ec2
    ph_auth_token: "p9d+65AW77775erAW3MlXTSOAROa4gIaCIi081Rx7Lg="
    public_ip: "192.0.2.1"
    public_dns: "ec2-192-0-2-1.compute-1.amazonaws.com"
    container_id: FUTURE
```
The `snort.py` program processes each alert generated, if the *msg* field contains the value specified in *msg_tag*, those alerts will be pushed to Phantom as artifacts.

Edit the `local.rules` file to identify what signatures Snort should use and which alerts to use as the basis of artifacts.
```
administrator@olive-iron:~/docker/cat9k-soar/library$ cat snort/local.rules

```
Build the Docker image. Note the Dockerfile configuration requires this to be run from the library directory.

```
administrator@olive-iron:~/docker/cat9k-soar/library$ docker build -f ./snort/Dockerfile -t joelwking/snort:1.0 .
```
Run the image.

```
administrator@olive-iron:~/docker/cat9k-soar/library$ docker run -it --name snort joelwking/snort:1.0

Generate traffic which matches the `local.rules` file.

```

The console output indicates the artifacts were added to the Phantom container.

```
Log on the Phantom GUI, review the container and artifacts created. Then, generate a new API authorization token in Phantom. Following that change, the app fails due to an invalid token.

Save the image to a tar file, which can be copied to the Catalyst 9K and installed.
```
administrator@olive-iron:~/docker/cat9k-soar/library$ docker save -o /tmp/snort.tar joelwking/snort:1.0
